# basic function practice

#start with def, define function
# same naming conventions as rest of python
#need () then :
#everything inside the function needs to be indented 
#stuff inside () is a passed variable that is needed to use the function
def helloThere(insult, name):
    print("Kenobi!?")
    print("Hello There " + insult + " " + name)

# must call the funtion to have it run in file

helloThere("stinky","mike")
